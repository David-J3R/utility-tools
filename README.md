# utility-tools
This repository contains a collection of small, practical tools built using R, Python, and Jupyter notebooks.

## What's Inside
This repository contains a growing collection of practical Python utilities I've built to solve specific problems:

 - **NLP_techniques**: Natural language processing tools for text analysis, including tokenization, stemming, and basic sentiment analysis implementations.
- **Sentiment_Analysis**: More advanced sentiment analysis tools that can identify emotional content in text data.
- **Keyword_matching**: Tools to efficiently match keywords across datasets, supporting both exact and fuzzy matching techniques.
- **QR_generator**: Simple but powerful QR code generation with customization options.
- **Webp_Converter**: Utilities for converting images to and from the WebP format.

## Why This Exists
Two reasons this repository exists:

1. **For me**: I got tired of recreating the same utilities or hunting through old projects to find that one function I knew I'd written before.
2. **For you**: Small utilities like these represent the "long tail" of coding knowledge - they're incredibly useful when you need them but not significant enough to warrant dedicated packages.

## How To Use These Tools
Each notebook is self-contained with examples and documentation. You can:

- Run them directly in Google Colab
- Download them to use in your local environment
- Copy specific functions into your own projects

## Future Additions
This is a living repository. I'll continue adding new utilities as I create them.
